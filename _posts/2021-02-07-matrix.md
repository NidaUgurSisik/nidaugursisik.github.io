### What is a Matrix?
A matrix is a rectangular arrays of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns.

Matrices are commonly written in box brackets. The horizontal and vertical lines of entries in a matrix are called rows and columns, respectively. The size of a matrix is defined by the number of rows and columns that if contains. A matrix with m rows and n columns is called an m x n matrix or **m-by-n** matrix, while m and n are called its dimensions.

The individual items in a matrix are called its elements or entries.

Provided  that they are the same size, Two matrices can be added or subtracted element by element. The rule for matrix multiplication, however, is that two matrices can be multiplied only when the number of columns in the first equals the number of row in the second. Any matrix can be multiplied element-wise by a scalar from its associated field.

Matrices which have a single row are called **row vectors**, and those which ahve a single column are called **column vectors**. A matrix which has the same number of rows and columns is called a square matrix. In some contexts, such as computer algebra programs, it is useful to consider a matrix with no rows or no columns, called an **empty matrix**.
